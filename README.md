This project is a simple Hello World Android studios app. The app loads with a blue text "Hello World" and a picture of Earth along with a button on the bottom labeled "Goodbye World." When the button is pressed, the Earth picture becomes a picture of Earth on fire with a text above "Goodbye World." The user can go back and forth between the two screens using the button at the bottom. 

This is a play on the original "Hello World" idea for beginner projects. I thought, everyone always does "hello world" but does anyone ever write "goodbye world?" So I did that and put an appropriate picture to accommodate haha.
